<h1>Project: Recipes</h1>

This is my first The Odin Project project.
This simple website will consist of a main index page, and a couple of links.

By the end of this project, I hope to have demonstrated an understanding of basic HTML concepts, as well as Git, because those commits aren't going to write themselves!

This is gonna be so _brutal_.
