            <li>Vegetable oil.{200ml}</li>
            <li>1 cup of sliced Onions.</li>
            <li>Curry powder (coloring spice) {2 Tablespoons}.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="sub-heading">Steps</h3>
       <ol  class="list">
            <li>
                <p>Parboil chicken and liver (both together) with all the spices (a teaspoon of salt, half cup of sliced onions, a teaspoon of thyme spice, a teaspoon of curry, two seasoning cubes teaspoon each of powdered ginger and garlic).</p>
                <p>Allow the meat to cook for ten to fifteen minutes, taste for salt, then pick out and deep-fry. Be sure to reserve the stock (meat water)</p>
            </li>
            <li>Chop the cabbage, green beans, carrot, liver and set aside in a wide tray</li>
            <li>
                <p>Parboil the 4 cups of rice also and cook with half of the meat stock (water from the meat) and two cups of water, cook until it is about 70% done.</p>
                <p>Observe the rice closely. It doesn’t need to be too soft or too hard, just almost done</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Set your cooking pot on heat, allow drying, then pour in about 200ml of vegetable oil.</p>
                <p>Note: It is better to continue with the same oil you used while frying the meat (that is only if you fried the meats), you can reduce it to 200ml.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Allow heating, then add the sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Then add the chopped carrot and green beans, any of these two can actually go first.</p>
                <p>Add the chopped liver and sweet corn, stir.</p>
                <p>Meat stock (water from the meat) should follow, add ground pepper (optional), add a teaspoon of salt and, add 1 seasoning cube then stir and taste, you may add more salt.</p>
                <p>Add the green peas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir for 1-2 minutes then add cabbage and the curry powder (Curry is a yellowish spice that actually adds the yellowish color to fried rice, add and stir till you are satisfied with the color.)</p>
                <p>You would have a yellowish mixture that would often taste overly spiced, don’t worry the rice would balance the taste.</p>
                <p>If you are satisfied with the taste, then add the green pepper, stir.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Add the almost-done white rice and stir</li>
            <li>Stir all together, cover your pot and allow to simmer for 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>You're done!</li>
       </ol>
